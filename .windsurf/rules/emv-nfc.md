# Windsurf Rules for emvNfc

## Context7 Integration
Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation for Android, Kotlin, Java, or any third-party libraries. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library IDs and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

## Android Documentation
Always check the official Android documentation at https://developer.android.com/ for Android-specific questions, APIs, components, architecture patterns, and best practices to ensure information is current and accurate.

## Library Documentation
When using a dependency or library, always search for it on https://mvnrepository.com/ or https://search.maven.org/ to verify:
- Latest version and compatibility
- Official documentation and usage examples
- Library maintenance status and release notes
- Implementation details and API reference
- Gradle dependency syntax

## Industry Best Practices & Optimization Research
Search online (Medium, dev.to, reddit, Android Developers Blog, ProAndroidDev, and other reputable sources) for:
- Recent articles on optimizations and performance improvements
- Industry-standard solutions and architectural patterns (MVVM, MVI, Clean Architecture, etc.)
- Trade-off analyses for technical decisions
- Real-world implementation experiences and case studies
- Current best practices for problems this project is solving
- Jetpack Compose vs XML Views considerations (if applicable)

This ensures the project follows modern, proven approaches and avoids outdated patterns.
